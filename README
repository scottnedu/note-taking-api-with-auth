# Note-Taking API

A simple RESTful API for managing notes, built with __Node.js__, __Express__, __TypeScript__, and __MongoDB__. This API allows you to create, read, update, and delete notes, as well as organize them by categories.

## Features  

1. Create a Note: Add a new note with a title, content, and category.

2. List All Notes: Retrieve all notes from the database.

3. Get a Specific Note: Fetch a single note by its ID.

4. Update a Note: Modify an existing note's title, content, or category.

5. Delete a Note: Remove a note by its ID.

6. Get Notes by Category: Fetch all notes belonging to a specific category.

7. Type Safety: Built with TypeScript for better type checking and developer experience.

8. Persistence: Uses MongoDB to store notes persistently.

9. I implemented basic authentication for the note-taking API

10. I added a user system with registration and login using typed controllers

11. I implemented JWT authentication with typed payloads for protected routes

12. I added two new endpoints with request validation via TypeScript:

     - POST ⁠ /api/auth/register ⁠ - Register a new user

     - POST ⁠ /api/auth/login ⁠ - Login and get JWT token
